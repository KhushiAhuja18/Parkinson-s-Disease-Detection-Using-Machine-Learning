# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
## Introduction
Parkinson's Disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management and treatment. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect Parkinson's Disease using various features extracted from voice recordings.

## Project Overview
This project utilizes SVM approach to classify and predict the presence of Parkinson's Disease. The dataset used in this project contains voice recordings from patients with and without Parkinson's Disease. Features such as frequency, amplitude, and other voice-related parameters are extracted from these recordings to train and test the machine learning model.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

## Dataet
The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasukani/parkinsons-disease-data-set) . It contains voice recordings from patients with and without Parkinson's Disease, along with extracted features.

## Results
he results indicate the model's effectiveness in detecting Parkinson's Disease from voice recordings.
